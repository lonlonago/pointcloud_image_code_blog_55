  ```  
   Create a surface mesh from the input point cloud ptCloudIn using the Poisson reconstruction method. The function also returns the octree depth and vertex density used in the reconstruction depth vertex density.

#  Fourth, a warning!!! 

   Copy and paste the code to run directly, and do not read other content of the blog. If you report an error, you will directly open "Why did I report an error, what kind of garbage code is this"??? pc2surfacemesh is a new function in matlab2022b and above, so why do some bosses make mistakes?? Why ask?????
