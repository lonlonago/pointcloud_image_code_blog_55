#  I. Overview 

##  1. Preface 

    There are ready-made call functions in matlab that can directly realize the construction of rotation matrices, such as rotating 30 ° around the x-axis, rotating 1 ° around the y-axis, first rotating around the x-axis, then rotating around z, and finally rotating around y and a series of basic operations. It's a matter of one line of code, and there is no need to write a fancy implementation process according to the formula. The purpose of using tools is to simplify complex problems. If you have to show your strong mathematical skills, wouldn't it be more advanced to do it by hand?

    Create a matrix for the angle of rotation of the vector or matrix around the axis (in angles, not radians). 

 When operating on a matrix, each column of the matrix represents a different vector. For rotation matrices and vectors, the rotation vector is given by. Similarly, the function of rotation around the y-axis is:
