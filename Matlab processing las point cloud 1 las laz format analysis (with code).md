#  I. Overview 

   The LAS file format is an industry standard binary format developed and maintained by the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) for storing LiDAR data. The LAZ file format is a compressed version of the LAS file format. The LAS file contains a common header with LiDAR metadata, followed by LiDAR point records. Each point record contains attributes such as 3D coordinates, intensity, and GPS timestamp. A lasFileReader object stores metadata in a LAS or LAZ file as read-only attributes. The object function, readPointCloud, uses these attributes to read point cloud data from the file.

#  Warning!!! 

   The lasFileReader function is a new function in matlab 2020b and above, so why do some bosses make mistakes?? Why ask??????
